            <h3>Alleppey Backwaters</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Alleppey backwaters  was earlier used as a mode of transportation, fishing and agriculture and have evolved over time as a tourism hotspot. The main attraction of the Alleppey backwaters is the overnight journey in the famous Kerala houseboats. These houseboats are as comfortable as any hotel room - sometimes even more luxurious, and as a bonus, you get the open deck.

Sunset viewing, bird watching, village visits, stargazing, witnessing the everyday life of the farmers and fishermen along with visiting the various regions that specialise in the manufacture of certain products like toddy, coir, handicrafts - Alleppey is a handful of an experience to have.

Alleppey is rightfully called the Venice of the East. With its labyrinth of brackish lagoons and interconnected lakes, Alleppey or Alappuzha is no less than the famous European city - neither in beauty nor in history and culture. Hire your boat and get started along the flow of the stream to soak in its beauty.

            <h3> Revi Karunakaran Museum</h3>
            <p>
                In 2003, Betty Karan built Revi Karuna Karan memorial museum at Alappuzha in memory of her husband.[1] This is now a renowned, privately owned museum holding one of the largest private collections of Swarovski crystals in the world along with porcelain, jade, ivory, Keralan artifacts, furniture, and Tanjore paintings.[2][3][4]

The family of Karunakarans have been avid collectors of fine art and artefacts since at least three generations.[5] The collection was originally maintained strictly within their private domain. However, after Revi's demise, Betty decided to open the collection to the public, as a befitting tribute to the memory of their most beloved husband and loving father. Lalichan Zachariah, an architect from Ernakulam, helped Betty design the museum. The museum was inaugurated on 22 November 2006 by the former governor of Meghalaya, Sri. M.M. Jacob.[1]

Built over a period of about three years, the RKK museum is noted for its architectural characteristics such as the frontal Greco-Roman columns and occupies an area of 28,000 sq ft.[2][1] A unique feature of the museum is that visitors can see and experience the four major religions of India — Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Christianity — that are represented with equal prominence across the murals, ivory collection, Kerala room and other items on display.[1] The 3rd phase of the museum was inaugurated on 22 November 2015 by Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the fifth President of Sri Lanka.[6][7][8] Most of the pieces displayed in the museum come with a certificate of authentication, personally certified by Betty.[9]

Many, including former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, have figuratively compared this museum to the Taj Mahal, as both were built in the same spirit as a symbol and memorial of spousal love
