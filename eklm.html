            <p>
                Bhoothathankettu is among the most picturesque dams in Kerala. It is said the natural fortification of hills and forests that guard the place were built by bhoothams (spirits/ghosts). Located in Ernakulam district, it contains some of the best trekking trails in the State. Trekking through the forests here is an exhilarating experience. A boat ride here is a beautiful way to explore the natural beauty on display. Located nearby is the legendary Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary at Thattekkad.

                The two main irrigation projects of Ernakulam district - the Periyar Valley Irrigation Project and the Idamalayar are also located nearby. One can also access pedal boats and cruises in these parts. It is a wonderful picnic spot about 10 km from Kodamangalam
